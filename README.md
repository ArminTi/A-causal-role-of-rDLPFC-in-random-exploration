# A-causal-role-of-rDLPFC-in-random-exploration

Project name:
"A Causal Role of rDLPFC in random exploration"

felow chart of data-analysis:

step 1: pre-process the data for each participant (converting to CSV, removing redundant parts, calculating uncertainity)

step 2: Creating a single csv file including all the participants data (name here: TMSanalysis_192_data.csv)

step 3: performing model-free analysis (run the modelfree_V2 code for figures 3,4, 5 and supplementory 1,4)

step 4: performing statistical analysis including repeated measure ANOVA (run the Statistical_Analysis code)

step 5: performing model-based with logistic rule model (run the modelbased_V2 code for figures 6,7 and supplementory 2, 3)

Note 1: for participants characteristics you can see : participants.csv file
Note: Some of the packages and codes are the modified version of the the available code in Zajkowski et al 2017 article
